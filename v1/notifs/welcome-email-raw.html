<p>Greetings,</p>

<p>You can now test Chorale!</p>

<p>In case you forgot: You requested early access to Chorale, a music app for listeners and creators. Looks like today is your lucky day, because you got it!</p>

<p>With that out of the way, here’s the juicy stuff:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="btn btn-primary">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td align="left">
        <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td> <a href="{{ .ConfirmationURL }}" target="_blank">Verify account</a> </td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The desktop web app can be accessed from <a href="https://web.choraleapp.com">web.choraleapp.com</a> on the <em>latest version</em> of Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. The app may not work with other browsers such as Microsoft Edge and is guaranteed to break in amazing ways on all versions of Internet Explorer. Because Internet Explorer is awful.</p>

<p>A dedicated Windows, macOS, or Linux version of the Chorale desktop app is not currently available, but that’s on our radar for sure. We will most likely start with Linux to make you feel bad, then move on to Windows. A macOS desktop app will not be available until a developer that has a some-thousand dollar machine can help us compile the app, though.</p>

<p>Mobile apps are currently still in development.</p>

<p>Make sure you have joined our Discord! Stay active on the guild if you want in-progress updates or want to contribute to the development of the project. Join with this link: <a href="https://discord.io/choraleapp">discord.io/choraleapp</a></p>

<p>And one last thing: Be vocal about the app! Please, do not hesitate to ask us any questions, do not hesitate to ask for new features, or anything of the like. Visit <a href="https://www.choraleapp.com/contact">www.choraleapp.com</a> to talk to us!</p>

<p>Thank you for being a part of the Chorale Tester Program! Have a nice day!</p>
